# Final-Countdown

Final-countdown is a little TUI app made with [CharmCLI](https://charm.sh/) (especially BublleTea, Bubbles and LipGloss).

It gives you the possibility to create a list of countdown saved in a file in your home directory.

## Install 

The usual way to install it is by downloading the zip associated to your os/architecture, unzip it and add it to your path.

Yet if you're a homebrew user, you can install it that way : 

`brew tap wecraftforfun/tools`

then 

`brew install final-countdown`
